### Lab 3 Report.

##### Exercise one.

- While working on this exercise, I was only challenged in creating the boxes to represent.
- I used CSS grid to acheive the desired output.
- It was easy to lay the boxes using the css grid.

##### Exercise Two.

- This was also a relatively easy exercise to implement.
- I used CSS grid to layout the elements in the menu box.

##### Exercise Three.

- This was a relatively challenging exercise to implement.
- I could not find a way to column 2 and column 3 content to the right.
- It was untill I looked at the solution to see that the only thing I was missing was adding float elements right.

##### Exercise Four.

- This was the most difficult and challenging exercise to implement.
- I did not pull off majority on the layouts with out using google and looking at the exercise solutions.

**Note**.

_I implemented all to exercise all in files ([layout.html](./layout.html) and [layout.css](./layout.css))_
